# Live Article Counter Implementation

I've added a live article counter to your news aggregator site that displays the total number of articles in the database and highlights newly added content. Here's what I've implemented:

## âœ… What's Been Added

1. **Live Article Counter Component**
   - Displays total article count with a pulsing "live" indicator
   - Shows newly added articles since last update
   - Updates automatically every 5 minutes
   - Added to both desktop and mobile layouts

2. **Database Integration**
   - New `site_stats` table to track article statistics
   - Database triggers to maintain accurate counts
   - Migration script for easy deployment

3. **Supabase Edge Function**
   - New `article-stats` function provides API access to stats
   - Handles CORS and error scenarios
   - Falls back to direct count if needed

4. **RSS Integration**
   - RSS processor now updates site stats with each run
   - Tracks newly added articles for highlighting

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Testing Without Deployment

```bash
# Start the test server (simulates the Edge Function)
npm run test-counter

# In another terminal, start your dev server
npm run dev
```

### Full Deployment

```bash
# Deploy the Edge Function and database migration
npm run deploy-stats

# Manually update article statistics
npm run update-stats
```

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation

- **Full Documentation**: See `ARTICLE_COUNTER_DOCS.md` for technical details
- **Test Server**: See instructions in console when running `npm run test-counter`
- **Components**: Check `ArticleCounter.tsx` for frontend implementation

## ðŸ“Š Next Steps (Optional)

- Add more detailed statistics (categories, trending)
- Create an admin dashboard for content metrics
- Implement user engagement tracking
- Add historical article growth charts

The article counter is now displayed next to the "Live" indicator on your site, showing visitors that your content is frequently updated with fresh news.
