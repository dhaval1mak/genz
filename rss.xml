      <description><![CDATA[A Bloomberg investigation reveals that the U.S. Treasury Department suffered three major cybersecurity breaches in the past five years due to a failure to implement basic security measures. The report highlights that readily available cybersecurity protocols, if deployed, could have prevented the attacks or significantly reduced the intrusion time. The investigation also suggests that budget cuts, specifically those impacting the Department's cybersecurity capabilities, have further weakened the agency's defenses, leaving it vulnerable to future attacks.]]></description>

A new study found altered patterns of these chemical tags in the eggs and embryos of individuals with PCOS. Epigenetic tags influence gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, potentially explaining how PCOS is inherited across generations.

Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina argues that the bill violates President Trump's promise not to cut Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate version of the bill could lead to nearly 12 million people losing health insurance due to significant reductions in Medicaid spending. While Trump claims the cuts target waste and abuse, Tillis questions how to justify the potential loss of coverage for hundreds of thousands of his constituents. The debate highlights a growing divide within the GOP regarding healthcare and budget priorities, as reported by KFF Health.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The White House anticipates a further decline in digital services taxes (DSTs) globally following Canada's recent decision to step back from implementing them. Kevin Hassett's statement arrives shortly before the U.S. government's deadline for potentially reinstating significant tariffs. These tariffs were initially threatened in response to various countries imposing DSTs, which the U.S. views as discriminatory towards American tech companies. The expectation is that other nations may reconsider their DST policies to avoid similar trade disputes with the United States.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Canada is reportedly considering scrapping its planned digital services tax (DST) due to pressure from the United States, particularly threats of tariffs from former President Donald Trump. The DST, aimed at taxing revenue generated by large tech companies operating in Canada, disproportionately affects US-based firms. Trump's tariff threats, intended to protect American interests, appear to be a significant factor in Canada's potential reversal. This move highlights the ongoing tension between national tax policies and international trade relations, particularly in the digital economy. Scrapping the DST would be a win for US tech giants, allowing them to avoid additional taxation in the Canadian market.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Germany is exploring Taiwan as a potential drone supplier to reduce its dependence on China. However, significant financial and political obstacles complicate direct procurement from Taipei. The move reflects a broader effort to diversify supply chains and mitigate geopolitical risks associated with relying on a single source for critical technology. Overcoming these hurdles would require navigating complex international relations and potentially addressing budgetary constraints within Germany's defense sector. The outcome could significantly impact Germany's defense capabilities and its strategic alignment in the Indo-Pacific region.]]></description>
